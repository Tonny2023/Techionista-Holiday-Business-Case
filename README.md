# Techionista-Holiday-Business-Case
The Power BI report in this repository is the outcome of a case study assignment.

For this assignment we have worked in a group of four people. 
We worked with an extensive dataset that is publicly available to everyone, for this assignment it is renamed as a database from the made-up company Techionista Holidays. 
Among other information, it contains reviews from their users after their stay at a hotel they booked through the Techionista Holidays website. These reviews
date from 2015 to 2017 and contain lots of information on how travelers have experienced their stay in various luxurious hotels across Europe.

Our assignment
The managers of the make-up Techionista Holidays website would love to gain more insight into the different types of travelers and their feedback to improve their website and their capability of catering to their users needs.

During this business case, we made use of a sentiment analysis function from Azure Cognitive Services. 
We connected to the data source and cleaned the data. Set up the Azure Cognitive Services in Azure and run the function in Power BI. Then we build our report and presented it in a short presentation of five minutes.
